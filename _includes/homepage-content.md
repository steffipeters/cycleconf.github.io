## Hackathon

Like last year CycleConf won't just be a place to learn from our amazing speakers. It will also be a place to build upon the ecosystem.
After an open pitching session teams can form around ideas to build technologies over the weekend. Every team will have an opportunity to present their work Sunday.
It might sound a bit intimidating, but it was a great success last year, even beginners had a great time in a learning and explorative atmosphere.
