## Scale

Cycle.js is still in its infancy, our aim is to organize a small and focused conference. We are setting the initial limit at 50 participants. In case of insane demand we may consider moving to a bigger venue and making a bigger event.

## Accommodation

We are unable to provide hosting for participants. Copenhagen has many hotels, cosy Airbnb apartments, and friendly couch-surfing hosts.

## Speakers

We are still looking for speakers, if you are interested to speak during the conference please contact [aron@risedigital.dk](mailto:aron@risedigital.dk) to introduce yourself and detail the topic of your presentations.

So far the confirmed speakers are:

|🇧🇷|[André Staltz](https://github.com/staltz)| RxJS core contributor, Creator of Cycle.js          | Brains as building blocks: how Cycle.js came into existence |
|🇺🇸|[Tylor Steinberger](https://github.com/tylors)| Cycle.js core contributor, Creator of Motorcycle.js | Routing in Cycle.js |

## Hacking

In addition to the speakers CycleConf wants to give participants a space to hack together and make the Cycle.js ecosystem even better. After the opening keynote there will be an opportunity to present your Cycle.js project, so other participants can join your team. We hope CycleConf will be a great space for connecting people around projects and new projects can emerge from our conference.
